    <h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: September 2, 2025</p>

    <p>FMRD collects and uses personal data for editorial and publishing purposes in accordance with the Philippine Data Privacy Act of 2012 and with internationally recognized standards. This statement explains what we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, how long we keep it, and the rights available to you.</p>

    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>This statement covers personal data of authors, co-authors, reviewers, editors, editorial board members, and readers who interact with our website and editorial systems.</p>

    <h2>What We Collect</h2>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>Account and profile details such as name, affiliation, position, email address, ORCID, country</li>
      <li>Manuscript and review related information such as submissions, revisions, reviewer reports, editor decisions, correspondence, and conflict of interest statements</li>
      <li>Publication metadata such as author names, affiliations, funder information, acknowledgments, references, and persistent identifiers</li>
      <li>Technical data such as IP address, browser type, device, and basic server logs generated by your use of the site</li>
      <li>Optional analytics data if we enable privacy-respecting analytics, with settings that avoid unnecessary tracking whenever possible</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Purposes and Lawful Bases</h2>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li><strong>Editorial and peer review workflow</strong>: to manage submissions, select reviewers, communicate decisions, and produce the scholarly record. Legal basis: performance of a contract or steps prior to a contract, and legitimate interests in running an academic journal.</li>
      <li><strong>Publication and indexing</strong>: to register DOIs, deposit metadata, and make articles discoverable. Legal basis: legitimate interests and legal obligations with registration agencies.</li>
      <li><strong>Integrity and compliance</strong>: to screen for similarity and research integrity issues and to handle ethics concerns. Legal basis: legitimate interests and legal obligations.</li>
      <li><strong>Website operation and security</strong>: to maintain and secure our website and services. Legal basis: legitimate interests.</li>
      <li><strong>Consent</strong>: where required, for example for optional profiles or communications beyond the core editorial service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third Parties and International Transfers</h2>
    <p>We share only what is necessary to deliver our services. Typical recipients include the following.</p>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li><strong>Crossref</strong> for DOI registration and metadata deposit</li>
      <li><strong>Similarity checking services</strong> for plagiarism screening</li>
      <li><strong>Indexing and discovery services</strong> if applicable</li>
      <li><strong>Website hosting and storage providers</strong> that support our site and editorial files</li>

    <p>Some providers may process data in other countries. We take reasonable steps to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place.</p>

    <h2>Cookies and Analytics</h2>
    <p>FMRD aims to minimize tracking. The site may use strictly necessary cookies for session management and security. If analytics are enabled, they are configured to collect aggregated data with limited identifiers. You can control cookies through your browser settings.</p>

    <h2>Retention</h2>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>Manuscript and peer review records are retained as part of the scholarly record and editorial audit trail.</li>
      <li>Reviewer identities are kept confidential within the editorial system unless a transparent review model is explicitly adopted and you consent to disclosure.</li>
      <li>Account data are retained while you have an active relationship with the journal and for a reasonable period after, to meet legal, archival, and research integrity obligations.</li>
      <li>Server logs are retained for a limited time for security and troubleshooting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Subject to applicable law, you may request access, rectification, deletion, restriction, or portability of your personal data, and you may object to processing based on legitimate interests. Some rights may be limited for legal or research integrity reasons, for example when records form part of the permanent scholarly record.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect personal data, including access controls, least-privilege permissions, and secure transmission where feasible. No method of transmission or storage is fully secure.</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>The journal is intended for adult researchers and students. If you believe a minor has provided personal data without appropriate consent, contact us so that we can address the matter.</p>

    <h2>Do Not Include Unnecessary Personal Data</h2>
    <p>Authors should avoid including sensitive personal information in manuscripts or supplementary files unless required by the research and covered by ethics approval and consent. When human participants are involved, provide anonymization or pseudonymization where appropriate and include consent statements.</p>
