    <h1>Publication Ethics &amp; Malpractice</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: September 2, 2025</p>

    <p>FMRD follows the principles and flowcharts of the <strong>Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)</strong>. We expect integrity from all parties, including authors, editors, reviewers, and the publisher, and we investigate alleged misconduct (such as plagiarism, uncredited reuse of text or figures, data fabrication or falsification, citation manipulation, salami slicing, undisclosed conflicts, and peer-review manipulation). Outcomes may include request for clarification, revision, rejection, <em>editorial note</em>, <em>corrigendum</em>, <em>expression of concern</em>, or <em>retraction</em>, as appropriate.</p>

    <h2 id="authorship">Authorship &amp; Contributorship (CRediT)</h2>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li><strong>Authorship criteria:</strong> Substantial contributions to the work; drafting or critical revision; final approval; and accountability for the work’s integrity.</li>
      <li><strong>Contributor roles:</strong> Authors must specify roles using the <em>CRediT</em> taxonomy (e.g., Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Validation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Data curation, Writing (original draft, Writing) review &amp; editing, Visualization, Supervision, Project administration, Funding acquisition).</li>
      <li><strong>Changes in authorship:</strong> Any addition, removal, or reordering after submission requires written agreement from all authors (including the added/removed) and editorial approval.</li>
      <li><strong>Acknowledgments:</strong> Individuals who contributed to the work but do not meet authorship criteria should be acknowledged with permission.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="similarity">Plagiarism &amp; Similarity Screening</h2>
    <p>All submissions are screened with similarity-checking software (Turnitin) <em>and</em> human assessment. Reports are interpreted in context; references, quotations, boilerplate methods, and legitimate reuse (with citation) are considered. Undisclosed text recycling or reuse without proper citation is not allowed.</p>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li><strong>Before review:</strong> Submissions with significant uncredited overlap may be returned to authors for revision or rejected.</li>
      <li><strong>During review/after acceptance:</strong> If concerns arise, editors may pause the process and investigate.</li>
      <li><strong>Post-publication:</strong> Verified plagiarism or inappropriate reuse may lead to correction, expression of concern, or retraction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="ai">Use of Generative AI &amp; LLMs</h2>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li><strong>No AI authorship:</strong> AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, code assistants) cannot be listed as authors. Human authors are responsible for all content, including text, figures, and code produced with AI assistance.</li>
      <li><strong>Disclosure required:</strong> If AI tools are used, authors must disclose <em>where and how</em> they were used (e.g., language editing, code generation, image creation) in the Methods or Acknowledgments, and verify originality, accuracy, and proper citations.</li>
      <li><strong>Data &amp; reference integrity:</strong> Fabricated/cited-in-error content attributed to AI is grounds for rejection or retraction.</li>
      <li><strong>Editorial checks:</strong> The journal may use AI-output detection <em>and</em> traditional checks; no single tool is determinative. Decisions are based on evidence and editorial judgment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="conflicts">Conflicts of Interest</h2>
    <p>All authors, editors, and reviewers must declare any financial or non-financial interests that could be perceived to influence the work (e.g., funding, employment, consultancies, stock ownership, honoraria, personal or institutional relationships, intellectual property). Authors must include a <em>Competing Interests</em> statement in the manuscript; editors will manage peer review to mitigate conflicts.</p>

    <h2 id="data">Data, Code &amp; Materials</h2>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Authors should make underlying data, code, and materials available in a trusted repository or provide a justified restriction statement (e.g., privacy, ethics, or legal constraints).</li>
      <li><strong>Reproducibility:</strong> Methods and analysis steps must be sufficiently detailed for replication. Upon request, authors may be asked to supply raw data, code, and detailed protocols to editors or reviewers.</li>
      <li><strong>Third-party rights:</strong> Authors must obtain permission for any copyrighted material and proprietary datasets.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="ethics-approvals">Human/Animal Research &amp; Consent</h2>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li><strong>Ethics approval:</strong> Studies involving humans or animals must state the approving IRB/ethics committee, protocol number (if applicable), and adherence to recognized standards.</li>
      <li><strong>Informed consent:</strong> Required for human participants; for case reports or identifiable images/data, include written consent for publication.</li>
      <li><strong>Clinical trials:</strong> Trial registration details should be provided where relevant.</li>
      <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Personally identifiable information must be minimized and appropriately protected.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="images">Image Integrity &amp; Manipulation</h2>
    <p>Image processing that alters meaning is prohibited. Non-misleading adjustments (e.g., brightness/contrast applied to the entire image) are acceptable if disclosed. Authors must retain original, unprocessed images and provide them on request.</p>

    <h2 id="preprints">Preprints, Conference Papers &amp; Prior Posting</h2>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li><strong>Preprints:</strong> FMRD welcomes submissions previously posted as preprints; authors must disclose the preprint DOI/URL and ensure no breach of third-party rights.</li>
      <li><strong>Conference papers:</strong> Substantially extended versions are eligible; overlap must be disclosed and appropriately cited.</li>
      <li><strong>Duplicate/redundant publication:</strong> Parallel submission to multiple journals or slicing one study into several minimally distinct papers is not allowed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="peerreview">Peer Review Integrity</h2>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li><strong>Model:</strong> FMRD uses a defined peer-review model (see <a href="peer-review.html">Peer Review Policy</a>).</li>
      <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Manuscripts and reviews are confidential; reviewers must not share or use material for personal advantage.</li>
      <li><strong>Conflicts:</strong> Reviewers and editors must recuse themselves from handling work where conflicts exist.</li>
      <li><strong>Misconduct:</strong> Any attempt to manipulate peer review (e.g., fabricated reviewer identities) will be investigated.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="investigations">Allegations, Investigations &amp; Sanctions</h2>
    <p>Editors assess concerns raised by readers, reviewers, or third parties. We follow COPE flowcharts when investigating and may contact authors’ institutions or funders. Potential outcomes include revision, rejection, retraction/notice, submission bans for a defined period, and notification to relevant bodies.</p>

    <h2 id="postpub">Corrections, Expressions of Concern &amp; Retractions</h2>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li><strong>Corrections (Errata/Corrigenda):</strong> Issued for honest errors that do not invalidate the work.</li>
      <li><strong>Expression of Concern:</strong> Posted when an investigation is ongoing but concerns are credible and serious.</li>
      <li><strong>Retractions:</strong> Issued when findings are unreliable or unethical practices are confirmed (e.g., fabrication, plagiarism, unethical research). Retraction notices are linked to the original article and state the reasons transparently.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="appeals">Appeals &amp; Complaints</h2>
    <p>Authors may appeal editorial decisions by writing to the Editor-in-Chief within 30 days, providing a reasoned response to reviewers’ and editors’ comments. Complaints about editorial process or ethics should be sent to <a href="mailto:editor@fmrd-journal.org">editor@fmrd-journal.org</a>. Appeals and complaints are reviewed by an editor not involved in the original decision (or by the publisher when necessary).</p>

    <h2 id="advertising">Advertising &amp; Sponsorship</h2>
    <p>FMRD does not accept advertising that could influence editorial decisions. Any sponsored content will be clearly labeled and kept separate from peer-reviewed material.</p>

    <h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>
    <p>Questions about this policy or potential breaches may be sent to <a href="mailto:editor@fmrd-journal.org">editor@fmrd-journal.org</a>. We welcome well-evidenced, good-faith reports.</p>
