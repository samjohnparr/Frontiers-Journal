    <h1>Peer Review Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: September 2, 2025</p>

    <p>FMRD uses <strong>double-blind</strong> peer review for all research articles and most article types. Authors and reviewers do not know each other’s identities. Editors make final decisions based on the reports and the journal’s editorial standards.</p>

    <h2>1. Editorial Screening</h2>
    <p>Every submission undergoes an initial check for scope fit, completeness, and policy compliance. The screening includes the following items.</p>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>Formatting and anonymization for double-blind review</li>
      <li>Similarity screening with human interpretation of overlaps</li>
      <li>Checks for undisclosed use of generative AI in writing, images, or code</li>
      <li>Ethics approvals and consent statements where required</li>
      <li>Data and code availability statements or justified restrictions</li>
      <li>Competing interests and funding disclosures</li>
      <li>Compliance with article type and reporting guidelines where applicable</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Reviewer Selection and Invitations</h2>
    <p>Editors invite at least two independent reviewers who have relevant expertise and no conflicts of interest. Selection considers prior performance and responsiveness. Authors may suggest or oppose reviewers, and editors may use these suggestions at their discretion. Editors do not rely solely on author-suggested reviewers.</p>

    <h2>3. Anonymity and Confidentiality</h2>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>Manuscripts and review materials are confidential and are used only for evaluation.</li>
      <li>Reviewers must not share or post content on public platforms, including public AI tools.</li>
      <li>If a reviewer uses private or institutional AI-assisted tools, they must keep all content confidential and must disclose this use to the editor. AI tools are not permitted to make the review decision.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Review Criteria</h2>
    <p>Reports should address the following points as relevant to the article type.</p>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>Originality and contribution to the field</li>
      <li>Methodological and statistical rigor</li>
      <li>Integrity of data, analyses, figures, and tables</li>
      <li>Clarity, organization, and adherence to reporting standards</li>
      <li>Appropriate citations and avoidance of unnecessary or coercive citations</li>
      <li>Ethical compliance, including approvals and consent</li>
      <li>Reproducibility and availability of data, code, and materials</li>
      <li>Fit to the journal’s aims and scope</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Decisions and Revision Rounds</h2>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li><strong>Accept</strong>: the manuscript is ready for production with minor editorial edits.</li>
      <li><strong>Minor revision</strong>: limited changes are needed. Authors submit a point-by-point response.</li>
      <li><strong>Major revision</strong>: substantial changes are needed. The revised manuscript may be re-reviewed.</li>
      <li><strong>Reject</strong>: the manuscript does not meet the journal’s requirements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Authors provide a detailed response to each reviewer and editor comment and must highlight or track changes in the manuscript. Double-blind conditions continue through all rounds until acceptance.</p>

    <h2>6. Timelines</h2>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>Initial editorial screening: about 5 to 7 days</li>
      <li>External review round: about 3 to 5 weeks</li>
      <li>Subsequent rounds: about 2 to 3 weeks per round</li>
      <li>Typical decision outcomes: accept, minor revision, major revision, or reject</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Times are indicative and can vary by article type and reviewer availability.</p>

    <h2>7. Handling of Submissions by Editors and Editorial Board Members</h2>
    <p>When an editor or board member is an author or has a potential conflict of interest, the submission is handled by an independent editor who is not affiliated with the authors or their institutions. The conflicted editor does not access reviewer identities or deliberations and does not participate in the decision.</p>

    <h2>8. Registered Reports</h2>
    <p>FMRD accepts Registered Reports. Stage 1 evaluates the research question, study design, and analysis plan before data collection. If Stage 1 is accepted in principle, Stage 2 evaluates adherence to the approved protocol and the completeness and transparency of results, independent of the direction of the findings.</p>

    <h2>9. Appeals and Complaints</h2>
    <p>Authors may appeal a decision within 30 days by sending a reasoned letter to the Editor-in-Chief. Appeals are reviewed by an editor who was not involved in the original decision. Complaints about editorial process or research integrity should be sent to <a href="mailto:editor@fmrd-journal.org">editor@fmrd-journal.org</a>. The journal follows COPE guidance in handling complaints and alleged misconduct.</p>

    <h2>10. Post-Publication Review and Corrections</h2>
    <p>Concerns that arise after publication are investigated. If confirmed, the journal may publish a correction, an editorial note, an expression of concern, or a retraction, depending on the severity and impact on the record.</p>

    <h2>11. Transparency on Articles</h2>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>Each published article lists the dates received, revised, and accepted.</li>
      <li>The article metadata states the peer review model used by the journal.</li>
      <li>Where relevant, the article includes data and code availability statements and competing interests.</li>
    </ul>
