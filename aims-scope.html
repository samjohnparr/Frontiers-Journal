    <h1>Aims &amp; Scope</h1>
    <p>The aim of the <strong>Frontiers in Multidisciplinary Research and Development (FMRD)</strong> is to publish high‑quality articles dedicated to the latest advances in <strong>Mathematics, Statistics, Data Science &amp; Computing</strong>; <strong>Environmental Science</strong>; <strong>Education</strong>; and the <strong>Social Sciences</strong>. Its scope encompasses theoretical, methodological, and applied contributions in these domains, which cover, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
    <p><strong>Mathematics, Statistics, Data Science &amp; Computing:</strong> analysis and differential equations; optimization and operations research; topology; algebra and geometry; graph and network theory; stochastic processes; time‑series and forecasting; spatial statistics and geostatistics; Bayesian methods; experimental design and survey sampling; uncertainty quantification; biostatistics and mathematical epidemiology; numerical and computational methods; machine learning and deep learning; explainable and responsible AI; natural language processing; computer vision; data mining and knowledge discovery; databases and information retrieval; distributed and high‑performance computing; software engineering (processes, tools, testing); human–computer interaction; privacy and security; Internet of Things (IoT); edge and cloud computing; cyber‑physical systems.</p>

    <p><strong>Environmental Science:</strong> climate variability and change, meteorology and atmospheric science, hydrology and water resources, oceanography and coasts, ecosystems and biodiversity, conservation and restoration ecology, air/water/soil pollution and environmental toxicology, waste management and circular economy, remote sensing and GIS, Earth observation and environmental sensor networks, disaster risk reduction and resilience, environmental modeling and decision support, sustainability transitions, environmental health and environmental epidemiology.</p>

    <p><strong>Education:</strong> STEM/mathematics/science education, curriculum design and alignment, outcomes‑based and competency‑based learning, assessment and psychometrics (validity, reliability, IRT), educational technology and learning analytics, immersive learning (AR/VR) and accessibility/Universal Design for Learning, teacher professional development and lesson study, classroom action research, equity and inclusion, language‑in‑education, indigenous knowledge systems and culturally responsive pedagogy, policy analysis and program evaluation, economics of education.</p>

    <p><strong>Social Sciences:</strong> economics and public policy, development studies and impact evaluation, causal inference and program assessment, sociology and anthropology, psychology (cognitive, educational, social), criminology and security studies (including privacy and cybercrime), demography and population studies, disaster management and community resilience, governance and risk communication, computational social science (social networks, text‑as‑data, geospatial analytics, time‑series and panel data).</p>

    <p>Interdisciplinary submissions situated at the interfaces (e.g., environmental data science, learning analytics, social epidemiology) are encouraged.</p>
